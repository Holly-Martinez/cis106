# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes 
 
## 1. What is an Operating System?

 An **operating system** provides all fundamental software feature of a computer. An **OS** enables the use of computer's hardware providing basic tools that makes a computer useful.
 
## 2. What is a kernel?

 An **OS** **kernel** is a software component that is responsible for managing *low-level* fetures of the computer, ***managing system hardware, memory allocation, CPU time, and program to program interaction***.

## 3. Which other parts aside from the kernel identfy an OS?

 * Command-Line Shells
 * Graphic User Interfaces
 * Utility and Productivity Programs 
 * Libaries 

## 4. What is linux?

 Linux is a **Unix-like Operating System** popular in acedemic and bussiness enviroments.Consists of **kernel**, **libaries**, and **utilities** making up the **OS**.Popular distributions **Arch,CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Red Hat, Slackware, Ubuntu** among more.   

## 5. What is a linux distribution? 
 
 A **Linux distribution** is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel and often a package management system.

  * A Linux Kernel
  * Core Unix Tools 
  * Supplemental Software 
  * Startup Scripts
  * An Installer

## 6. List at least 4 linux characteristics:

 * Open Source
 * Security
 * User interface
 * Flexibility

## 7. What is Ubuntu?

**Ubuntu** is a Linux distribution derived from *Debian* and composed mostly of *free and open-source software*. **Ubuntu** is officially released in multiple editions: ***Desktop, Server, and Core for Internet of things devices and robots***. 

## 8. What is Debian?

 **Debian**, also known as **Debian** GNU/Linux, is a *free and open source Linux distribution*, developed by the **Debian** Project,  established by Ian Murdock in August, 1993. **Debian** is the basis for many other distributions, such as ***Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Tails, Proxmox, Kali Linux, Pardus and Astra Linux***.

## 9. List and define the different types of licensing agreements

 Types of licensing agreements:
 * **open sorce**: software distributed for a fee or free and sorce code is distributed with the software.
 * **closed sorce**: software not distributed with sorce code. User restricted from modifying the code. 
## 10. What is Free Software? Define the 4 freedoms.

**Free software** is the software distributed with the sorce code, can or cannot be ffree or come with a fee.
* **freedom 0**:uses doftware for any purpose
* **freedom 1**:examine the source code and modify it as you see fit
* **freedom 2**:redistribute the software
* **freedom 3**:redistribute your modified software 

## 11. What is virtualization?

 **Virtualization** is creating virtual versions of something. **Virtualization** allows administrators to **divide the hardware** and create multiple computers *inside a single physical computer*. It is an old concept however it has gain popularity due to the availability of *faster, better and cheaper* hardware.

## 12. List 3 benefits of virtualization

* Reduces cost by decreasing the physical hardware that must be purchased for a network
* Offers the ability to save the state of a machine at given time and roll it back or foward
* Allows running multiple OSs on one machine without dual booting

## 13. What is a hypervisor? Include definitions of the 2 types

**Hypervisor** is a software or hardware in charge of crreating, managing, anf running virtual machines.
* **Type 1**:runs directly on the hardware, basically the operating system for hte physical machine, better performance, no host OS involved. 
* **Type 2**: an application that runs on the top of an operating system

## 14. What is the difference between Guest OS and Host OS?

 **Host OS** are running the computer where the hypervisor is installed and **Guest OS** is being virtulized in the virrtual machine.

## 15. What is virtualbox?

**Virtualbox** is a powerful x86 and **AMD64/Intel64** virtualizarion product for enterprise as well as home use.It is an **Open Source Software** that is freely avaiable, extremely feature rich, high performance product.
